description: End-of-day windup — write day summary in plan/, update plan/pending.md, ensure plan/ is gitignored, commit/push non-plan changes, print resume handoff
---

Wind up the current project for today. Execute these 6 steps in order, working in the current project's repo root.

If the current directory is not inside a git repo, stop and ask the user which project to wind up — do not guess.

## 1. Day summary

Write `plan/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-summary.md` with what happened today. Gather context from:
- This session's conversation
- `git log --since=midnight --oneline --all` for commits made today
- `git status` and `git diff` for any uncommitted work

Cover, in this order:
- **Shipped** — what landed (PRs, commits, deploys), each with its commit SHA
- **Verified** — how it was checked (tests / typecheck / build / manual) and what verification is still owed (e.g. "needs runtime test")
- **Decisions** — what was chosen and why (especially anything non-obvious)
- **Tried then rolled back** — dead ends worth remembering so we don't repeat them
- **Open questions** — anything that surfaced today but isn't resolved

Keep it tight — bullet points, not prose. The future-self reading this wants signal, not a transcript.

## 2. Pending items

Write or update `plan/pending.md`. The canonical structure (shared with /replan-nt) is:

```
# Pending

## Now
- <actionable, top priority>

## Parked
- <deferred, not in scope right now but not abandoned>

## Open questions
- <question that needs answering before it can become a task>
```

Merge rules:
- **File exists with sections:** preserve them. New items surfaced today go into `Now` by default, or `Open questions` if phrased as a question. Remove items finished today from wherever they sit. Don't touch `Parked` unless something explicitly moved out of scope today.
- **File exists, flat (no sections):** keep it flat — don't restructure mid-windup. Just add new items and remove finished ones. (User can run `/replan-nt` when ready to migrate to the structured form.)
- **File doesn't exist:** create it with the three sections (canonical from day one).

Order items by priority within each section. Each item is one line — link to a deeper plan/ doc if there's more context. `pending.md` is the source of truth for what's open; execution order is the workplan's job (next step).

## 3. Workplan

Write or update `plan/workplan.md`. The workplan reorganizes `plan/pending.md` into chunks the next session can pick up and execute without re-thinking the strategy. Each chunk groups items that are:
- **Logical** — same area, feature, module, or file
- **Convenient** — small items and quick wins batched so they ship in one sitting
- **Related** — natural dependencies or sequencing flow

For each chunk include:
- A short title (what binds the items together); mark a **keystone** chunk others depend on
- 2–5 items pulled from `pending.md`, each a **tri-state checkbox**: `[ ]` open · `[x]` done · `[~]` partial
- A rough size estimate (e.g., "30 min", "half day", "1–2 hours") — keep it loose
- Optional: a note on prerequisites or sequencing

Item conventions:
- A `[~]` partial / deferred item states what's done, what's left, and what would un-defer it — point at `/decide-nt` when the blocker is a decision.
- If a chunk came from a `/forward-pass-nt`, `/walkthrough-nt`, `/ux-review-nt`, or `/maintain-nt`, carry the finding IDs (`C1`, `H2`, …) and a `[test]` marker on any item whose verification is still owed.

Items that don't yet cluster into a chunk go under a `## Unbatched` section — that flags they need more thought before they're actionable.

Order chunks so the next session can pick the top one and start. `pending.md` is the flat source of truth; `workplan.md` is the curated play.

## 4. Verify plan/ is gitignored

Check that `plan/` (or `/plan/`) appears in the repo's `.gitignore`. If not, add it. The plan/ folder is local-only working notes — its contents must not be pushed to remote.

## 5. Commit and push non-plan changes

- Run `git status` to see what's outside plan/.
- If there are uncommitted changes outside plan/: stage them (by path, never `git add -A`), commit with a clear one-line message summarizing the day's work, then `git push` to the current branch's upstream.
- If there's nothing to commit, skip the commit but still attempt `git push` in case earlier local commits haven't been pushed.
- If the repo has no remote configured or the push fails, note it in the final handoff message rather than silently swallowing the error.
- Never force-push. Otherwise, push without prompting — including to `main`/`master`. (windup is end-of-session ritual; if the user invoked it, they're authorizing the push.)

## 6. Resume handoff (the final message)

Print a clear, tight handoff message in this exact shape:

```
Wound up <project-name> for today.

Folder: <absolute path>
Resume next session: cd <absolute path> and run /resume-nt

Next chunk — <title from top of workplan.md>:
  - <item>
  - <item>
  - <item>
```

This is the bridge to the next conversation — the folder path must be absolute and copy-pasteable, and the named chunk should be the one the next session should grab first. `/resume-nt` will read the workplan + pending + latest summary and brief the user automatically.
